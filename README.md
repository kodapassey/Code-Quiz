# Code-Quiz

# Description: 
Code-Quiz is a time based JavaScript quiz that gives the user 60 seconds to answer 10 coding related questions, primarly JavaScript related questions. If the user answers a question correctly they will be alerted that the question was correct and will be moved to the next question with no penalties. However, if a user incorrectly answers a question, 5 seconds will be subtracted from their time and the user will be alerted the answer they chose was incorrect. The score the player recieves is determined by the time remaining when they finish the quiz or when the time hits 0. if the user achieves the highest score, or if there are no highscores saved yet, the user gets the ability to save their highscore by inputting their initials. If the user does not beat the current highscore, they will be alerted and page will refresh giving them a new chance to take the quiz and get the highscore. At the bottom of the page the user can see the best score achieved under highscore section.
